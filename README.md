CS50X Problem Set Solutions
Welcome to my CS50X repository! Here, you’ll find my solutions to the problem sets from Harvard’s CS50X course—Introduction to Computer Science. Each folder corresponds to a different problem set, and within each folder, you’ll find my code and any relevant explanations.

Table of Contents
Problem Set 1: C
Hello: A simple “Hello, world!” program.
Mario: Printing Mario-style pyramids.
Cash: Calculating the minimum number of coins for change. <!-- Add more as needed -->
Problem Set 2: Arrays
Caesar: Implementing a Caesar cipher.
Substitution: Implementing a substitution cipher. <!-- Add more as needed -->
Problem Set 3: Algorithms
Plurality: Simulating a plurality election.
Runoff: Simulating an instant runoff election. <!-- Add more as needed -->
<!-- Continue with additional problem sets -->

Usage
Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and adapt it for your own understanding. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know!

Acknowledgments
I’d like to express my gratitude to the CS50X team at Harvard for creating this fantastic course. Their lectures, problem sets, and community have been invaluable in my learning journey.
